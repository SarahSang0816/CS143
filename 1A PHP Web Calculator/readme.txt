We both learned php and unix operations. 
To implement the calculator, we studied the basic calculation principles. 
Preg_match() and eval() are main functions we used to solve this problem. 
We found that the correct impression should be one number by itself, or followed by an operator and another number. 
The number can be positive or negative, integer or decimal. 
Besides, division zero error was also considered here. The eval() function was used to evaluate the correct impression.
