We learned how to use MySQL and how to access it from the Apache server. 
We created a few tables to contain information about movies and actors, load them with (real) data we are providing, and run a few queries to get familiar with MySQL. 
We also created a php page that allows users to query your MySQL database using HTML forms. 
Finally, we also identified a few constraints that the tables should satisfy and enforce them for the tables.
