We developed a user interface to query movie databases. 

The functionality of our web interface includes:
(1) keyword search:
For example:
search keyword “santa” 
The search result will include 7 matching actors and 3 matching movies.
(2) user can add actor/director/movie/review as well as movie/director movie/actor relations to database. The user-added information is stored in the database and can be searched after adding. 
Each functional webpage is written in PHP.

The User Interface of our Web interface:
(1) There is search button is on right top corner and can be used at any page of the website.
(2) We use pop-down menu bar so that user can move the cursor and see what options they can do on the website. 
The UI was implemented using CSS, Jquery.
